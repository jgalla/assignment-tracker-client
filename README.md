# Assignment Tracker

This is a simple assignment tracker. The inspiration came from the fact
that I currently use a basic spreadsheet in Google Docs, so this will be useful for
the remainder of the course. In addition, it covers all the necessary components to
implement what we've learned so far without venturing too far outside of the class
scope.
